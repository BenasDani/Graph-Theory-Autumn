# Graph-Theory-Autumn Repeat - G00385085
This is my graph theory module assignment readme. It contains two jupyter notebooks created in colab.research.google that explains how graph thory can be applied to sorting elements in an array, and talking about the the graph isomorphism problem.

#Heap Sort Notebook
• Explanation of what a rooted binary tree is.
• Overview of how the heap sort algorithm works, with reference to trees.
• Python function implementing Heap Sort.
• Explanation why, in the worst case, heap sort is more efficient than bubble sort.

#Graph-Isomorphism Notebook
• Definition of graph isomorphism.
• Specification of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.
• Python function to determine whether two graphs are isomorphic.
• Explanation of the main reason computer scientists are interested in the complexity of
the Graph Isomorphism Problem.

#Running Jupyter Notebooks
Jupiter notebooks can be ran on ww.colab.research.google.com by pasting in my github repository which is https://github.com/BenasDani/Graph-Theory-Autumn.
