        "# Rooted Binary Tree\n",
        "A binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node has at most two children. A rooted tree naturally imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root), thus for every node a notion of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below. If m = 2, the rooted tree is called a binary tree.\n",
